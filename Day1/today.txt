Day1:

-I started with a course from Dr.Angela Yu's udemy video(Data Science and Machine Learning video)
- 6 steps of ML:
	1) Formulate Question
	2) Gather Data
	3) Clean Data
	4) Explore and visualize Data
	5) Train Algorithm
	6) Evaluate 
- Learnt basics of Linear Regression algorithm:
	Key Points: y= mx+c in form H(x) = theta_0 + theta_1 * x
		    Feature / Target
		    Residuals: Sum of squares of difference between functional value and value from the assumed line
		    Line with minimum residual sum is the optimum solution

Implemented a LinearRegression model in jupyter notebook using pandas, scikitlearn, DataFrame and visualized using matplotlib.pyplot



Error Stuck Update: 
convert dataframe to an array by accessing the single column from the DF, i.e X = x['production_budget_usd']
type(x) = pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
type(X) = numpy.ndarray
