# X-Days-of-Data-Science-and-ML
Goal: 
The aim of this X days series is not to keep a track of my learning process. I have tried learning ML in bits and pieces in the past but this time I don't want to be distracted and lose track to what I learnt. I am not starting from the basic but from an existing knowledge of python and few python modules like matplotlib, pandas and Numpy. 


Navigation:
- There are folders corresponding to each day that I learn
- today.txt file explains what I learnt and did throughout the day
