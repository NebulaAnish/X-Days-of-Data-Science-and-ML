# X-Days-of-Data-Science-and-ML
Goal: 
The aim of this X days series is to keep a track of my learning process. I have tried learning Data Science & ML in bits and pieces in the past but this time I don't want to be distracted and lose track to what I learnt. I am not starting from the basic but from an existing knowledge of python and few python modules like matplotlib, pandas and Numpy. My goal is to first master data science before getting deep into ML.
